# Team Meetings
November 11th from 11PM to 12AM
Larry, Owen, and Charles were present.
We discussed what software we were going to develop our game in after discovering that Unity was not going to work for us. We ended up deciding on SFML through Visual Studio.
We decided that we would each research how to set up SFML.

December 5th from 2pm-4pm
Charles, Larry, and Keith were present.
We discussed what final touches needed to be added to our game and split up to work.
Charlie would start on the collision detection while Larry works on moving the starting positions of the hole and ball. Keith would work on making the ball movement more realistic, which is what he has been tasked with this entire time and still hasnt done. 


# How to run/compile
